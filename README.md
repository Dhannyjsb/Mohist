# Mohist Made in China

Since CraftBukkit has modified a lot of underlying layers, some of the core mods are not available, we are working hard to improve.
## Mohist-1.12.2 will continue to be maintained..
## Mohist is still in beta and you may encounter issues in using it with your server. You have been warned!
